# ADR-2025-09-08: Tool-Specific Pattern Evaluation Framework

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: Stephen Szermer  
**Client Context**: All Risk Profiles (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)

## Context

### Problem Statement
As AI development tools proliferate rapidly, QED needs systematic approaches for evaluating vendor-specific tools and APIs that go beyond general framework selection criteria. The Nano Banana (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) evaluation revealed gaps in QED's framework for assessing usage-based AI services with significant vendor lock-in and cost scaling concerns.

### Project Context
- **Need**: First tool-specific evaluation following QED knowledge intake process
- **Scope**: Establish pattern for evaluating vendor-specific AI APIs and services
- **Timeline**: Immediate framework establishment, ongoing refinement
- **Evidence**: Successful completion of Nano Banana analysis using enhanced evaluation criteria

### Business Requirements
- Systematic approach to vendor-specific tool evaluation
- Cost modeling for usage-based AI services
- Vendor lock-in risk assessment methodology
- Production readiness gap identification
- Clear client risk profile mapping

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing QED tier system
- Cannot rely solely on vendor documentation
- Need objective risk assessment matrices
- Require production deployment validation paths

## Decision

**What we decided**: Establish enhanced evaluation framework specifically for vendor-specific AI tools, demonstrated through Google Gemini Nano Banana analysis.

**Key Components**:
- **Extended Risk Matrix**: Add vendor lock-in, cost scaling, and service continuity factors
- **Production Gap Analysis**: Mandatory identification of missing enterprise patterns
- **Cost Modeling Requirements**: Total cost of ownership analysis including failure scenarios
- **Vendor Risk Assessment**: Explicit evaluation of service deprecation history and lock-in potential
- **Three-tier Client Mapping**: Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive recommendations with specific constraints

## Framework Enhancement

### New Evaluation Criteria

**Vendor-Specific Risk Factors**:
1. **Service Continuity Risk** - Historical pattern of service deprecation
2. **Cost Predictability** - Scaling behavior and hidden costs
3. **Lock-in Severity** - Migration difficulty and abstraction possibilities
4. **Production Readiness Gaps** - Missing enterprise patterns in vendor documentation
5. **Competitive Positioning** - Alternative solutions and switching costs

**Enhanced Analysis Structure**:
- Executive Summary with confidence scoring (X/25)
- Source credibility assessment including vendor bias analysis
- Production readiness gap identification
- Cost modeling at scale (not just per-unit pricing)
- Client context mapping with explicit risk warnings
- Knowledge gap analysis for Tier 3 promotion requirements

### Implementation Results

**Nano Banana Evaluation Demonstrates**:
- ✅ Systematic vendor bias identification (Google employee author)
- ✅ Cost scaling analysis ($39/day at 1000 images = $1,170/month)
- ✅ Production gap documentation (rate limiting, error handling, monitoring)
- ✅ Vendor lock-in risk assessment (Google's service deprecation history)
- ✅ Client context mapping (not suitable for conservative clients)
- ✅ Clear Tier 2 placement with specific promotion criteria

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Generic Framework Application
**Description**: Apply existing QED framework without tool-specific enhancements  
**Pros**: 
- Consistent with established processes
- No additional framework complexity
- Familiar evaluation structure
**Cons**: 
- Misses vendor-specific risks (service continuity, lock-in)
- Inadequate cost modeling for usage-based services
- No systematic approach to production readiness gaps
**Why rejected**: Generic framework missed critical vendor-specific considerations revealed in Nano Banana analysis

### Alternative 2: Vendor-Neutral Analysis Only
**Description**: Focus exclusively on open-source or self-hosted alternatives  
**Pros**: 
- Avoids vendor lock-in issues entirely
- Consistent with some practitioner preferences
- Eliminates cost unpredictability
**Cons**: 
- Ignores reality that clients often need vendor solutions
- Misses legitimate use cases for managed AI services
- Doesn't help practitioners evaluate when vendor tools are appropriate
**Why rejected**: QED must provide guidance for real-world scenarios including vendor tool evaluation

### Alternative 3: Separate Framework for Each Vendor
**Description**: Create distinct evaluation criteria for Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.  
**Pros**: 
- Highly specific to each vendor's characteristics
- Could capture unique vendor-specific patterns
- Detailed risk modeling per vendor
**Cons**: 
- Framework proliferation and maintenance overhead
- Difficult to compare across vendors
- Would require expertise in each vendor's ecosystem
**Why rejected**: Scalability concerns and comparison difficulties outweigh specificity benefits

## Risk Assessment

Using QED Risk Assessment Matrix:

| Factor | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Client Impact | 2 | Enhanced evaluation protects clients from vendor-specific risks |
| Security | 2 | Framework improvements include security pattern gap identification |
| Maintainability | 3 | Additional evaluation criteria require ongoing refinement |
| Transparency | 1 | Clear documentation of vendor-specific evaluation approach |
| Skill Dependency | 4 | Requires developing expertise in vendor risk assessment |

**Overall Risk**: Low-Medium

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Document evaluation criteria clearly for consistency
- Create templates for common vendor-specific patterns
- Regular framework review based on evaluation outcomes
- Train on multiple vendor evaluations to refine criteria

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Framework Documentation (Completed)
- **Timeline**: 1 day
- **Deliverables**: Enhanced evaluation criteria, Nano Banana analysis as example
- **Success Criteria**: Systematic vendor-specific evaluation demonstrated
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Phase 2: Template Development (Next)
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Deliverables**: Standardized templates for tool-specific evaluation
- **Success Criteria**: Consistent application across different vendor tools
- **Dependencies**: Additional tool evaluations to validate template

### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis (Ongoing)
- **Timeline**: Next 3 evaluations
- **Focus Areas**: Cross-vendor comparison methodologies
- **Success Criteria**: Ability to provide relative risk assessments

## Expected Consequences
