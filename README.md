# Building an Agentic System

A deep-dive guide into architecture patterns for building responsive, reliable AI coding agents.

## About This Book

This guide explores practical architecture patterns for real-time AI coding assistants, derived from an analysis of Claude Code, anon-kode, and other systems. It focuses on:

- Responsive user interfaces with streaming responses
- Parallel tool execution for performance
- Permission systems for safety
- Extensible tool architecture

Written for software engineers building their own AI agents who want practical architecture patterns rather than theoretical discussions.
