# Startup Context Patterns

Patterns optimized for small teams (<10 developers) with high agility and low process overhead.

## Your Environment
- 🚀 Rapid iteration needed
- 💰 Cost-sensitive decisions
- 👥 Small, versatile team
- 🔄 Frequent pivots expected
- ⚡ Speed over perfection

## Recommended Patterns

### Quick Wins (Start Here)
1. [System Prompts and Model Settings](../../patterns/implementation/system-prompts-and-model-settings.md)
   - Immediate productivity boost
   - No infrastructure required
   - Individual developer adoption

2. [Framework Selection Guide](../../patterns/implementation/framework-selection-guide.md)
   - Choose minimal viable tools
   - Avoid over-engineering
   - Focus on time-to-market

3. [Parallel Tool Execution](../../patterns/operations/parallel-tool-execution.md)
   - Speed up development cycles
   - Reduce waiting time
   - Improve developer experience

### Building Foundations
- [Execution Flow in Detail](../../patterns/implementation/execution-flow-in-detail.md) - Understand the basics
- [Comments and Collaboration](../../patterns/team/comments.md) - Light collaboration
- [Initialization Process](../../patterns/implementation/initialization-process.md) - Quick setup

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Over-architecting**: Don't implement enterprise patterns prematurely
❌ **Heavy process**: Skip formal approval chains
❌ **Premature optimization**: Focus on working code first
❌ **Complex tooling**: Use what you know

## Startup Priorities

### Phase 1: Individual Productivity (Weeks 1-2)
- Get AI tools working for each developer
- Focus on code generation and debugging
- Measure time saved

### Phase 2: Team Alignment (Weeks 3-4)
- Standardize prompts and workflows
- Share successful patterns
- Document what works

### Phase 3: Process Integration (Month 2)
- Integrate with existing tools
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Track metrics

## Cost Optimization

### Free/Low-Cost Options
- Start with free tiers of AI services
- Use open-source alternatives where possible
- Share API keys responsibly (with limits)

### When to Invest
- After proving value with metrics
- When hitting scaling limits
- For critical productivity tools

## Scaling Considerations

### Signs You're Outgrowing Startup Patterns
- Team > 10 developers
- Multiple products/services
- Customer data handling
- Compliance requirements
- Need for formal processes

### Next Steps
→ Move to [Mid-Market Patterns](../mid-market/index.md) when:
- Team doubles in size
- Processes become bottlenecks
- Quality concerns arise
- Customers demand more rigor

## Success Metrics

Track these from day one:
- ⏱️ Development velocity increase
- 🐛 Bug reduction rate
- 😊 Developer satisfaction
- 💵 Cost per feature
- 🚀 Time to deployment

## Common Mistakes

1. **Trying to do everything at once**
   - Solution: Pick one pattern, prove it works, then expand

2. **Ignoring security basics**
   - Solution: Use permission systems even in MVP

3. **Not measuring impact**
   - Solution: Simple metrics from day one

4. **Solo implementation**
   - Solution: Get buy-in from at least one teammate

- [Real World Examples](../../patterns/implementation/real-world-examples.md)

### Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] Choose an AI tool (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- [ ] Set up basic prompts
- [ ] Implement one pattern fully
- [ ] Measure results for one week
- [ ] Share learnings with team
- [ ] Iterate and expand

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of shipped**. Start small, prove value, then scale.
