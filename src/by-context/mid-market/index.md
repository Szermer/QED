# Mid-Market Context Patterns

Patterns optimized for mid-market organizations (100-1000 employees) balancing growth with governance.

## Scaling Patterns

Mid-market organizations face unique challenges:
- Growing beyond startup chaos but not yet enterprise-scale
- Building processes while maintaining agility
- Establishing governance without bureaucracy

## Recommended Patterns

### Architecture
- [Core Architecture](../../patterns/architecture/core-architecture.md) - Foundation for scalable systems
- [Thread Management at Scale](../../patterns/architecture/thread-management.md) - Managing growing conversation volume

### Team & Process
- [Team Workflows](../../patterns/team/team-workflows.md) - Collaborative development patterns
- [From Local to Collaborative](../../patterns/team/local-to-collaborative.md) - Transitioning to team-based AI

### Security
- [Authentication and Identity](../../patterns/security/authentication-identity.md) - Centralizing access control
- [Sharing and Permissions](../../patterns/security/sharing-permissions.md) - Team-based permissions

## Key Considerations

- **Start with managed risk patterns** - Balance innovation with stability
- **Focus on team collaboration** - Enable knowledge sharing across growing teams
- **Implement gradual governance** - Add controls as needed, not preemptively
- **Plan for growth** - Choose patterns that scale to enterprise needs
