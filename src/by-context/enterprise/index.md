# Enterprise Context Patterns

Patterns for large organizations (1000+ employees) with complex governance requirements.

## Governance Patterns

Enterprise organizations require:
- Comprehensive compliance and audit trails
- Multi-level approval workflows
- Integration with existing enterprise systems
- Strict security and data governance

## Recommended Patterns

### Architecture
- [Core Architecture](../../patterns/architecture/core-architecture.md) - Enterprise-grade foundation
- [Multi-Agent Orchestration](../../patterns/architecture/multi-agent-orchestration.md) - Complex workflow automation
- [Real-Time Synchronization](../../patterns/architecture/real-time-sync.md) - Global team coordination

### Team & Process
- [Enterprise Integration](../../patterns/team/enterprise-integration.md) - Connecting with enterprise systems
- [Team Workflows](../../patterns/team/team-workflows.md) - Structured collaboration

### Security & Compliance
- [Authentication and Identity](../../patterns/security/authentication-identity.md) - SSO and identity federation
- [The Permission System](../../patterns/security/the-permission-system.md) - Fine-grained access control
- [Sharing and Permissions](../../patterns/security/sharing-permissions.md) - Complex permission models

### Operations
- [Observability and Monitoring](../../patterns/operations/observability-monitoring.md) - Enterprise monitoring
- [Performance at Scale](../../patterns/operations/performance-at-scale.md) - Handling enterprise load

## Key Considerations

- **Compliance first** - Meet regulatory requirements before deployment
- **Integration complexity** - Plan for lengthy enterprise system integration
- **Change management** - Invest in training and adoption programs
- **Risk mitigation** - Use proven patterns with extensive validation
