# Contextualizing an Agentic System

## Introduction to Tools and Commands

Welcome to the comprehensive reference for tools and commands that power modern agentic systems. This section provides detailed documentation of the core capabilities that make AI coding assistants effective in real-world scenarios.

## Overview

Building effective agentic systems requires understanding the tools at your disposal and how to orchestrate them effectively. This reference covers two critical categories:

### Tools - The Building Blocks

Tools represent the fundamental capabilities your agentic system can perform:
- **File Operations**: Reading, writing, and editing code and documentation
- **System Interaction**: Executing commands and interacting with the environment  
- **Memory Management**: Persistent storage and retrieval of context
- **Communication**: Interfacing with external systems and users

### Commands - The User Interface

Commands provide structured ways for users to interact with and configure your agentic system:
- **Configuration**: Model settings, authentication, and preferences
- **Workflow**: Managing conversations, contexts, and collaboration
- **Development**: Code review, debugging, and deployment assistance
- **Maintenance**: System health, updates, and troubleshooting

## How to Use This Reference

Each tool and command is documented with:
- **Purpose**: What the capability does and when to use it
- **Implementation**: Technical details and patterns
- **Examples**: Real-world usage scenarios
- **Integration**: How it connects with other system components

## Important Note

> **⚠️ Deprecated Reference Format**  
> The detailed tool and command references that follow represent documentation extracted from production systems. While comprehensive, they follow an older documentation format that will be superseded by future structured guides.
> 
> Use these references for implementation details, but expect more curated guidance in future releases.
