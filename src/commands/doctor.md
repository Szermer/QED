### doctor Command

The `doctor` command provides a diagnostic tool for checking the health of the Claude Code installation, with a focus on npm permissions required for proper auto-updating functionality.

#### Implementation

The command is implemented in `commands/doctor.ts` as a type: 'local-jsx' command that renders a React component:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import type { Command } from "../commands";
import { Doctor } from "../screens/Doctor";

const doctor: Command = {
  name: "doctor",
  description: "Checks the health of your Claude Code installation",
  isEnabled: true,
  isHidden: false,
  userFacingName() {
    return "doctor";
  },
  type: "local-jsx",
  call(onDone) {
    const element = React.createElement(Doctor, {
      onDone,
      doctorMode: true,
    });
    return Promise.resolve(element);
  },
};

export default doctor;
```

The command uses the `Doctor` screen component defined in `screens/Doctor.tsx`, passing the special `doctorMode` flag to indicate it's being used as a diagnostic tool rather than during initialization.

#### Functionality

The `doctor` command implements a comprehensive installation health check focused on npm permissions:

1. **Permissions Verification**:

   - Checks if the npm global installation directory has correct write permissions
   - Determines the current npm prefix path
   - Validates if auto-updates can function correctly

2. **Status Reporting**:

   - Provides clear success or failure messages about installation health
   - Shows a green checkmark and confirmation message for healthy installations
   - Presents an interactive dialog for resolving permission issues

3. **Problem Resolution**:

   - Offers three remediation options when permission problems are detected:
     1. **Manual Fix**: Provides a sudo/icacls command to fix permissions on the current npm prefix
     2. **New Prefix**: Guides the user through creating a new npm prefix in their home directory
     3. **Skip**: Allows deferring the fix until later

4. **Installation Repair**:
   - For the "new prefix" option, provides a guided, step-by-step process to:
     - Create a new directory for npm global packages
     - Configure npm to use the new location
     - Update shell PATH configurations
     - Reinstall Claude Code globally

#### Technical Implementation Notes

The command demonstrates several sophisticated implementation patterns:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Uses React components for the UI, allowing for a rich interactive experience.

2. **Platform-Aware Logic**: Implements different permission-fixing approaches for Windows vs. Unix-like systems:

   - Windows: Uses `icacls` for permission management and `setx` for PATH updates
   - Unix: Uses `sudo chown/chmod` for permission fixes and shell config file updates

3. **Shell Detection**: For Unix platforms, identifies and updates multiple possible shell configuration files:

   - .bashrc and .bash_profile for Bash
   - .zshrc for Zsh
   - config.fish for Fish shell

4. **Status Management**: Uses React state to track:

   - Permission check status
   - Selected remediation option
   - Custom prefix path (if chosen)
   - Step-by-step installation progress

5. **Lock-Based Concurrency Control**: Implements a file-based locking mechanism to prevent multiple processes from attempting auto-updates simultaneously.

6. **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error reporting and recovery options:
   - Shows precisely which operation failed
   - Offers alternative approaches when errors occur
   - Logs error details for debugging

#### User Experience Benefits

The `doctor` command addresses several important pain points for CLI tool users:

1. **Installation Troubleshooting**: Provides clear diagnostics and fixes for common problems:

   - Permission issues that prevent updates
   - Global npm configuration problems
   - PATH configuration issues

2. **Security-Conscious Design**: Offers both privileged (sudo) and non-privileged (new prefix) solutions, allowing users to choose based on their security preferences.

3. **Multi-Platform Support**: Works identically across Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-appropriate solutions.

4. **Shell Environment Enhancement**: Automatically updates shell configuration files to ensure the installation works correctly across terminal sessions.

5. **Visual Progress Feedback**: Uses spinners and checkmarks to keep users informed about long-running operations.

The command provides a comprehensive diagnostics and repair tool that helps maintain a healthy Claude Code installation, particularly focusing on the auto-update capability which is crucial for keeping the tool current with new features and improvements.
