### config Command

The `config` command provides an interactive terminal interface for viewing and editing Claude Code's configuration settings, including model settings, UI preferences, and API keys.

#### Implementation

The command is implemented in `commands/config.tsx` as a type: 'local-jsx' command that renders a React component:

```typescript
import { Command } from "../commands";
import { Config } from "../components/Config";
import * as React from "react";

const config = {
  type: "local-jsx",
  name: "config",
  description: "Open config panel",
  isEnabled: true,
  isHidden: false,
  async call(onDone) {
    return <Config onClose={onDone} />;
  },
  userFacingName() {
    return "config";
  },
} satisfies Command;

export default config;
```

Like the `bug` command, this command uses JSX to render an interactive UI component. The actual functionality is implemented in the `Config` component located in `components/Config.tsx`.

#### UI Component

The `Config` component implements a rich terminal-based settings interface with the following features:

1. **Settings Management**: Displays a list of configurable settings with their current values.

2. **Multiple Setting Types**: Supports various setting types:

   - `boolean`: Toggle settings (true/false)
   - `enum`: Options from a predefined list
   - `string`: Text input values
   - `number`: Numeric values

3. **Interactive Editing**: Allows users to:

   - Navigate settings with arrow keys
   - Toggle boolean and enum settings with Enter/Space
   - Edit string and number settings with a text input mode
   - Exit configuration with Escape

4. **Configuration Persistence**: Saves settings to a configuration file using `saveGlobalConfig`.

#### Configuration Options

The component exposes numerous configuration options, including:

1. **Model Configuration**:

   - AI Provider selection (anthropic, openai, custom)
   - API keys for small and large models
   - Model names for both small and large models
   - Base URLs for API endpoints
   - Max token settings
   - Reasoning effort levels

2. **User Interface**:

   - Theme selection (light, dark, light-daltonized, dark-daltonized)
   - Verbose output toggle

3. **System Settings**:
   - Notification preferences
   - HTTP proxy configuration

#### Technical Implementation Notes

The `Config` component demonstrates several advanced patterns:

1. **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` to track:

   - Current configuration state
   - Selected setting index
   - Editing mode state
   - Current input text
   - Input validation errors

2. **Reference Comparison**: Maintains a reference to the initial configuration using `useRef` to track changes.

3. **Keyboard Input Handling**: Implements sophisticated keyboard handling for navigation and editing:

   - Arrow keys for selection
   - Enter/Space for toggling/editing
   - Escape for cancellation
   - Input handling with proper validation

4. **Input Sanitization**: Cleans input text to prevent control characters and other problematic input.

5. **Visual Feedback**: Provides clear visual indication of:

   - Currently selected item
   - Editing state
   - Input errors
   - Available actions

6. **Change Tracking**: Tracks and logs configuration changes when exiting.

#### User Experience Design

The config component showcases several UI/UX design principles for terminal applications:

1. **Modal Interface**: Creates a focused settings panel that temporarily takes over the terminal.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Shows relevant controls and options based on the current state.

3. **Clear Instructions**: Displays context-sensitive help text at the bottom of the interface.

4. **Visual Highlighting**: Uses color and indicators to show the current selection and editing state.

5. **Immediate Feedback**: Changes take effect immediately, with visual confirmation.

6. **Multiple Input Methods**: Supports keyboard navigation, toggling, and text input in a unified interface.

7. **Safe Editing**: Provides validation and escape routes for configuration editing.

The `config` command demonstrates how Claude Code effectively combines the simplicity of terminal interfaces with the rich interaction capabilities typically associated with graphical applications, creating a powerful yet accessible configuration experience.
