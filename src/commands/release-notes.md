### release-notes Command

The `release-notes` command provides users with a simple way to view the changes and new features introduced in each version of Claude Code, helping them stay informed about updates.

#### Implementation

The command is implemented in `commands/release-notes.ts` as a type: 'local' command that formats and displays release notes from a constant:

```typescript
import { MACRO } from "../constants/macros.js";
import type { Command } from "../commands";
import { RELEASE_NOTES } from "../constants/releaseNotes";

const releaseNotes: Command = {
  description: "Show release notes for the current or specified version",
  isEnabled: false,
  isHidden: false,
  name: "release-notes",
  userFacingName() {
    return "release-notes";
  },
  type: "local",
  async call(args) {
    const currentVersion = MACRO.VERSION;

    // If a specific version is requested, show that version's notes
    const requestedVersion = args ? args.trim() : currentVersion;

    // Get the requested version's notes
    const notes = RELEASE_NOTES[requestedVersion];

    if (!notes || notes.length === 0) {
      return `No release notes available for version ${requestedVersion}.`;
    }

    const header = `Release notes for version ${requestedVersion}:`;
    const formattedNotes = notes.map((note) => `• ${note}`).join("\n");

    return `${header}\n\n${formattedNotes}`;
  },
};

export default releaseNotes;
```

This command demonstrates a simple but effective approach to displaying versioned information, using a constant defined in `constants/releaseNotes.ts` as the data source.

#### Functionality

The `release-notes` command provides a straightforward information display:

1. **Version Selection**:

   - Defaults to showing notes for the current version
   - Allows explicit version selection through command arguments
   - Handles cases where notes are unavailable for a version

2. **Note Formatting**:

   - Displays a clear header indicating the version
   - Formats individual notes as bullet points
   - Presents notes in a readable, consistent format

3. **No Dependencies**:

   - Doesn't require external API calls or complex processing
   - Works entirely with data embedded in the application

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides a friendly message when notes aren't available
   - Gracefully handles empty or missing note arrays

#### Technical Implementation Notes

While simpler than many other commands, the `release-notes` command demonstrates several effective patterns:

1. **Constant-Based Data Store**: Uses a predefined constant for storing release notes data:

   ```typescript
   // Example from constants/releaseNotes.ts
   export const RELEASE_NOTES: Record<string, string[]> = {
     "0.0.22": [
       "Added proxy configuration support via --proxy flag or HTTP_PROXY environment variable",
       "Improved error handling for API connectivity issues",
       "Fixed issue with terminal output formatting in certain environments",
     ],
     "0.0.21": [
       "Enhanced model selection interface with provider-specific options",
       "Improved documentation and help text for common commands",
       "Fixed bug with conversation state persistence",
     ],
   };
   ```

2. **Default Value Pattern**: Uses the current version as a default if no specific version is requested:

   ```typescript
   const currentVersion = MACRO.VERSION;
   const requestedVersion = args ? args.trim() : currentVersion;
   ```

3. **Array Transformation**: Uses map and join for clean formatting of bullet points:

   ```typescript
   const formattedNotes = notes.map((note) => `• ${note}`).join("\n");
   ```

4. **Null-Safe Access**: Checks for undefined or empty notes before attempting to display them:

   ```typescript
   if (!notes || notes.length === 0) {
     return `No release notes available for version ${requestedVersion}.`;
   }
   ```

5. **Command Availability Control**: The command is marked as disabled with `isEnabled: false`, suggesting it may be under development or available only in certain builds.

#### User Experience Benefits

Despite its simplicity, the `release-notes` command provides several valuable benefits:

1. **Update Awareness**: Helps users understand what has changed between versions.

2. **Feature Discovery**: Introduces users to new capabilities they might not otherwise notice.

3. **Version Verification**: Allows users to confirm which version they're currently using.

4. **Historical Context**: Provides access to past release information for reference.

5. **Simplified Format**: Presents notes in a clean, readable format without requiring browser access.

The `release-notes` command exemplifies how even simple commands can provide valuable functionality through clear organization and presentation of information. It serves as part of Claude Code's approach to transparency and user communication.
