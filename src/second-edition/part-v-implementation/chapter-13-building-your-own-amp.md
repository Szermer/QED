# Chapter 13: Building Your Own Collaborative AI Assistant

So you want to build a collaborative AI coding assistant. Maybe you've been inspired by the architecture patterns we've explored, or perhaps your team has specific requirements that existing tools don't meet. This chapter provides a practical roadmap for building your own system, drawing from the lessons learned throughout this book.

## Starting with Why

Before diving into technology choices, clarify your goals. Are you building for:
- A small team that needs custom integrations?
- An enterprise with specific security requirements?
- A SaaS product for developers?
- An internal tool that needs to work with proprietary systems?

Your answers shape every decision that follows. A system for five developers looks very different from one serving thousands.

## Architecture Decisions Checklist

Let's work through the key architectural decisions you'll face, organized by importance and dependency order.

### 1. Deployment Model

**Decision**: Where will your system run?

Options:
- **Local-first with sync**: Like Amp's original architecture. Each developer runs their own instance with optional cloud sync.
- **Cloud-native**: Everything runs in the cloud, accessed via web or thin clients.
- **Hybrid**: Local execution with cloud-based features (storage, collaboration, compute).

Trade-offs:
- Local-first offers privacy and works offline but complicates collaboration
- Cloud-native simplifies deployment but requires reliable connectivity
- Hybrid balances both but increases complexity

For MVP: Start local-first if privacy matters, cloud-native if collaboration is primary.

### 2. Language Model Integration

**Decision**: How will you integrate with LLMs?

Options:
- **Direct API integration**: Call OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. directly
- **Gateway service**: Route through a unified API layer
- **Local models**: Run open-source models on-premise
- **Mixed approach**: Gateway with fallback options

Trade-offs:
- Direct integration is simple but locks you to providers
- Gateway adds complexity but enables flexibility
- Local models offer control but require significant resources

For MVP: Start with direct integration to one provider, design for abstraction.

### 3. Tool System Architecture

**Decision**: How will tools interact with the system?

Options:
- **Built-in tools only**: Fixed set of capabilities
- **Plugin architecture**: Dynamic tool loading
- **Process-based isolation**: Tools run in separate processes
- **Language-agnostic protocols**: Support tools in any language

Trade-offs:
- Built-in is fastest to implement but limits extensibility
- Plugins offer flexibility but require careful API design
- Process isolation improves security but adds overhead
- Language-agnostic maximizes flexibility but increases complexity

For MVP: Start with built-in tools, design interfaces for future extensibility.

### 4. State Management

**Decision**: How will you manage conversation and system state?

Options:
- **In-memory only**: Simple but loses state on restart
- **File-based persistence**: JSONLines, SQLite, or similar
- **Database-backed**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- **Event sourcing**: Full history with replay capability

Trade-offs:
- In-memory is trivial but impractical for real use
- File-based works well for single-user scenarios
- Databases enable multi-user but add operational complexity
- Event sourcing provides audit trails but requires careful design

For MVP: File-based for single-user, PostgreSQL for multi-user.

### 5. Real-time Communication

**Decision**: How will components communicate?

Options:
- **REST APIs**: Simple request-response
- **WebSockets**: Bidirectional streaming
- **Server-Sent Events**: One-way streaming
- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC
- **Message queues**: Async communication

Trade-offs:
- REST is universally supported but not real-time
- WebSockets enable real-time but require connection management
- SSE is simpler than WebSockets but one-directional
- gRPC offers performance but less ecosystem support
- Message queues decouple components but add infrastructure

For MVP: REST + SSE for streaming responses.

### 6. Authentication and Authorization

**Decision**: How will you handle identity and permissions?

Options:
- **None**: Single-user system
- **Basic auth**: Simple username/password
- **OAuth/OIDC**: Integrate with existing providers
- **API keys**: For programmatic access
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control

Trade-offs:
- No auth only works for personal tools
- Basic auth is simple but less secure
- OAuth leverages existing identity but adds complexity
- API keys work well for automation
- RBAC scales but requires careful design

For MVP: Start with API keys, add OAuth when needed.

```typescript
// Start with a simple tool interface
interface Tool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: JSONSchema;
  execute(params: any): Promise<ToolResult>;
}

// Basic tools to implement first
const readFile: Tool = {
  name: "read_file",
  description: "Read contents of a file",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      path: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["path"]
  },
  async execute({ path }) {
    // Implementation
  }
};
```

Key milestones:

- Add progress indicators
- Implement undo/redo for edits
- Polish error messages
- Add configuration options

### Phase 3: Collaboration (Weeks 9-12)

Enable team usage.

- Build sharing infrastructure
- Add access controls
- Implement usage tracking
- Create admin interfaces
- Document deployment

### Phase 4: Scale (Months 4-6)

Prepare for growth.

- Performance optimization
- Horizontal scaling
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security hardening
- Compliance features

## Scaling Considerations

Design for scale from day one, even if you don't need it immediately.

### Data Architecture

**Conversation Storage**:
- Partition by user/team from the start
- Use UUIDs, not auto-increment IDs
- Design for eventual sharding
- Keep hot data separate from cold

**File Handling**:
- Stream large files, don't load into memory
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Use CDN for shared resources
- Implement progressive loading

### Performance Patterns

**Tool Execution**:
```typescript
// Design for parallel execution from the start
class ToolExecutor {
  async executeBatch(tools: ToolCall[]): Promise<ToolResult[]> {
    // Group by dependency
    const groups = this.groupByDependency(tools);
    
    const results: ToolResult[] = [];
    for (const group of groups) {
      // Execute independent tools in parallel
      const groupResults = await Promise.all(
        group.map(tool => this.execute(tool))
      );
      results.push(...groupResults);
    }
    
    return results;
  }
}
```

**Response Streaming**:
- Use server-sent events or WebSocket
- Stream tokens as they arrive
- Buffer for optimal chunk sizes
- Handle connection interruptions

### Security Considerations

**Input Validation**:
- Sanitize all file paths
- Validate command inputs
- Rate limit by user and endpoint
- Implement request signing

**Isolation**:
- Run tools in sandboxed environments
- Use separate service accounts
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Audit all operations

### Operational Excellence

**Monitoring**:
```yaml
# Key metrics to track from day one
metrics:
  - api_request_duration
  - llm_token_usage
  - tool_execution_time
  - error_rates
  - active_users
  - conversation_length
```

**Deployment**:
- Automate everything
- Use feature flags
- Implement gradual rollouts
- Plan for rollback
- Document runbooks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering the MVP**: Resist adding features before core functionality works well.

2. **Ignoring operational concerns**: Logging, monitoring, and deployment automation pay dividends.

3. **Tight coupling to LLM providers**: Abstract early, even if you use just one provider.

4. **Underestimating UI/UX**: Developer tools need good design too.

5. **Skipping tests**: Integration tests for tools save debugging time.

6. **Premature optimization**: Profile first, optimize what matters.

7. **Ignoring security**: Build security in from the start, not as an afterthought.
