# Appendix B: Deployment Pattern Guide

This guide covers deployment principles and strategies for collaborative AI coding assistants, focusing on architectural patterns, capacity planning, and operational practices that scale from small teams to enterprise deployments.

## Deployment Strategy Overview

### Containerization Strategy

Real-time AI systems benefit from containerized deployments that isolate dependencies, enable consistent environments, and support rapid scaling. Key principles:

**Service Separation**: Split application into discrete servicesâ€”API servers, background workers, real-time sync handlers, and tool execution environments. Each service scales independently based on load patterns.

**Stateless Design**: Design application containers to be stateless, storing all persistent data in external databases and caches. This enables horizontal scaling and simplified deployment rollouts.

**Health Check Integration**: Implement comprehensive health endpoints that check not just process health but dependencies like databases, external APIs, and cache layers.

**Resource Boundaries**: Set explicit CPU and memory limits based on workload characteristics. AI-heavy workloads often require more memory for model loading and context management.

```yaml
# Example container resource strategy
small_team_deployment:  # 1-50 users
  api_servers:
    replicas: 2
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "2Gi"
  workers:
    replicas: 3
    cpu: "500m" 
    memory: "1Gi"
    
enterprise_deployment:  # 500+ users  
  api_servers:
    replicas: 6
    cpu: "2000m"
    memory: "4Gi"
  workers:
    replicas: 12
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "2Gi"
```

### Architecture Patterns

**Single-Region Pattern**: For teams under 100 users, deploy all components in a single region with local redundancy. Use load balancers for high availability and database read replicas for query performance.

**Multi-Region Active-Passive**: For global teams, deploy primary infrastructure in your main region with read-only replicas in secondary regions. Route users to nearest read endpoints while writes go to primary.

**Multi-Region Active-Active**: For enterprise scale, run fully active deployments in multiple regions with eventual consistency patterns. Requires careful design around data conflicts and user session affinity.

**Hybrid Cloud**: Combine cloud infrastructure for scalability with on-premises components for sensitive data or compliance requirements. Use secure tunnels or API gateways for communication.

## Capacity Planning Framework

### Resource Sizing Methodology

AI coding assistants have unique resource patterns that differ from traditional web applications. Use these guidelines for initial sizing:

**CPU Requirements**: Scale based on concurrent requests rather than total users. Each active conversation thread consumes CPU for tool execution, code analysis, and real-time synchronization. Plan for 0.5-1 CPU cores per 10 concurrent conversations.

**Memory Patterns**: Memory usage scales with conversation context size and caching strategies. Plan for 4-8GB base memory plus 100-200MB per concurrent conversation for context and tool execution buffers.

**Storage Growth**: Conversation data grows linearly with usage. Estimate 1-5MB per conversation thread depending on code file attachments and tool outputs. Include 3x growth factor for indexes and metadata.

**Network Bandwidth**: Real-time features drive bandwidth requirements. Plan for 1-10KB/second per active user for synchronization plus burst capacity for file transfers and tool outputs.

### Scaling Triggers

**Horizontal Scaling Indicators**:
- CPU utilization consistently above 70%
- Response latency P95 above target SLAs  
- Queue depth for background tasks growing
- Connection pool utilization above 80%

**Vertical Scaling Indicators**:
- Memory pressure causing frequent garbage collection
- Disk I/O saturation affecting database performance
- Network bandwidth utilization above 70%

### Database Architecture Strategy

**Scaling Strategies**:
- Start with read replicas for query performance improvement
