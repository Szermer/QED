- Security and compliance needs
- Budget and timeline constraints
- Technical sophistication level
- Documentation and audit requirements

**Project Characteristics:**
- Greenfield vs. existing codebase
- Team size and experience
- Technology stack complexity
- Integration requirements
- Maintenance expectations

**Success Criteria:**
- Quality standards
- Performance requirements
- Scalability needs
- Time-to-market priorities
- Long-term support plans

### 2. Framework Evaluation Matrix

Use this decision tree for each framework component:

graph TD
    A[Framework Component] --> B{Production Ready?}
    B -->|No| C[Avoid for Client Work]
    B -->|Yes| D{Matches Client Risk Profile?}
    D -->|No| E[Document Risk & Get Approval]
    D -->|Yes| F{Team Has Required Skills?}
    F -->|No| G[Training Required]
    F -->|Yes| H{Clear ROI?}
    H -->|No| I[Defer Until Value Clear]
    H -->|Yes| J[Adopt with Monitoring]
```
