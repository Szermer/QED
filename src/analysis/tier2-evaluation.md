# Tier 2: Under Evaluation

Patterns and frameworks currently undergoing critical analysis before promotion to proven practice.

## Evaluation Framework

All patterns in this tier are evaluated using:

### Risk Assessment Matrix
- **Technical Risk**: Implementation complexity and failure modes
- **Security Risk**: Data exposure and vulnerability potential
- **Operational Risk**: Maintenance burden and scalability concerns
- **Business Risk**: Cost implications and vendor lock-in

### Client Context Analysis
- **Conservative Profile**: Risk-averse enterprises and regulated industries
- **Moderate Profile**: Growth-stage companies balancing innovation and stability
- **Aggressive Profile**: Startups and innovation labs prioritizing speed

### Implementation Feasibility
- **Resource Requirements**: Team skills, time, and infrastructure needed
- **Integration Complexity**: Compatibility with existing systems
- **Migration Path**: Effort required to adopt or abandon

## Currently Under Evaluation

### Pattern: Autonomous Agent Orchestration
**Status**: Testing in controlled environments
**Risk Level**: High
**Evaluation Period**: Q1 2025

**Key Questions:**
- How to maintain deterministic behavior?
- What guardrails prevent runaway processes?
- How to audit and trace agent decisions?

**Initial Findings:**
- Promising for repetitive tasks
- Requires extensive monitoring
- Not suitable for critical path operations

### Pattern: Context Window Optimization
**Status**: Gathering performance metrics
**Risk Level**: Managed
**Evaluation Period**: Q4 2024 - Q1 2025

**Key Questions:**
- What's the optimal context size for different tasks?
- How to manage context switching efficiently?
- When does context size impact quality?

**Initial Findings:**
- Significant cost implications
- Quality plateaus around 50K tokens
- Chunking strategies show promise

### Pattern: Hybrid Human-AI Workflows
**Status**: Client pilot programs
**Risk Level**: Managed
**Evaluation Period**: Ongoing

**Key Questions:**
- Where are the optimal handoff points?
- How to maintain context across transitions?
- What approval mechanisms work best?

**Initial Findings:**
- Clear ownership boundaries essential
- Async workflows more successful than sync
- Review fatigue is real concern

### Pattern: Multi-Model Ensembles
**Status**: Cost-benefit analysis
**Risk Level**: Managed
**Evaluation Period**: Q1 2025

**Key Questions:**
- When do ensembles outperform single models?
- How to manage increased latency?
- What's the cost multiplication factor?

**Initial Findings:**
- Useful for critical decisions
- 3-5x cost increase typical
- Consensus mechanisms complex

## Evaluation Pipeline

### Stage 1: Initial Assessment (2-4 weeks)
- Literature review and vendor claims
- Technical feasibility analysis
- Initial risk assessment

### Stage 2: Proof of Concept (4-8 weeks)
- Controlled environment testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Security review

### Stage 3: Pilot Program (8-12 weeks)
- Limited production deployment
- Real-world metrics collection
- User feedback gathering

### Stage 4: Decision Point
- **Promote**: Move to Tier 3 (Proven Practice)
- **Iterate**: Return to earlier stage with modifications
- **Reject**: Document reasons and archive

## Rejected Patterns

### Pattern: Fully Autonomous Code Deployment
**Rejection Date**: December 2024
**Reason**: Unacceptable risk profile

**Key Issues:**
- No reliable rollback mechanisms
- Insufficient testing coverage
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Loss of human oversight

### Pattern: Cross-Repository Context Sharing
**Rejection Date**: November 2024
**Reason**: Security and privacy concerns

**Key Issues:**
- IP leakage between projects
- GDPR/privacy violations
- Insufficient access controls
- Context pollution problems

## Upcoming Evaluations

### Q1 2025 Pipeline
1. **Semantic Code Search** - Using embeddings for code discovery
2. **Automated PR Reviews** - AI-driven code review automation
3. **Predictive Resource Scaling** - AI-based capacity planning

### Q2 2025 Pipeline
1. **Voice-Driven Development** - Natural language programming
2. **AI Pair Programming** - Real-time collaborative coding
3. **Automated Documentation Generation** - Context-aware docs
