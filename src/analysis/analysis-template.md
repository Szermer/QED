## Risk Assessment

Using the QED Risk Assessment Matrix:

| Factor | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Client Impact | [score] | [reasoning] |
| Security | [score] | [data privacy, code security concerns] |
| Maintainability | [score] | [long-term support, debugging complexity] |
| Transparency | [score] | [client understanding, audit trails] |
| Skill Dependency | [score] | [team expertise requirements] |

**Overall Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/Medium-High/High]

## Technical Feasibility

**Implementation Requirements**:
