# Analysis Directory

This directory contains **Tier 2** content - critical analysis of research material under professional evaluation.

## Purpose

Bridge between raw research (`docs/`) and proven practice (main `src/` content). Each document represents your professional assessment of potential patterns, tools, or frameworks.

## Standards

- **Objective analysis** using established risk matrices
- **Client context** considerations for all assessments  
- **Evidence-based** conclusions with supporting data
- **Clear recommendations** with actionable next steps

## File Naming

`analysis-[topic]-[YYYY-MM].md`

Examples:
- `analysis-framework-wars-2025-01.md`
- `analysis-mcp-integration-2025-01.md` 
- `analysis-claude-workflows-2025-01.md`

## Analysis Template

See `analysis-template.md` for the standard structure to follow.

## Current Analysis Documents

### Framework Assessments
- Analysis documents are stored in this directory but not linked in the main navigation
- See individual files for specific evaluations

### Strategic Analysis
*Strategic positioning and market analysis documents from intake processing*

### Process Evaluations
*Workflow and methodology evaluations from intake processing*

## Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: High-priority research items get analysis documents
2. **Updates**: Quarterly review for relevance and accuracy
3. **Promotion**: Successful experiments move to main content
4. **Archive**: Outdated or rejected analyses move to `archive/` folder
