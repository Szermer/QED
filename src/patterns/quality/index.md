# Quality & Validation Patterns

Quality assurance and validation patterns for AI-assisted development.

## Core Patterns

- [Risk Assessment](risk-assessment.md) - Evaluating implementation risks

## Quality Frameworks

### Code Quality
- Static analysis integration
- Linting and formatting
- Complexity metrics
- Technical debt tracking

### Testing Strategies
- Unit testing patterns
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing

### Validation Approaches
- Output verification
- Consistency checking
- Regression testing
- A/B testing

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories
- Technical risks
- Security risks
- Operational risks
- Business risks

### Mitigation Strategies
- Risk assessment matrices
- Mitigation planning
- Contingency procedures
- Regular reviews

## Quality Metrics

### Development Metrics
- Code coverage
- Bug density
- Cycle time
- Lead time

### AI-Specific Metrics
- Accuracy rates
- False positive/negative rates
- Response time
- Token efficiency

## Continuous Improvement

- Retrospectives
- Metric tracking
