# Architecture & Design Patterns

Core system design patterns and architectural decisions for AI coding assistants.

## Foundational Patterns

- [Core Architecture](core-architecture.md) - Essential layers and components
- [System Architecture Diagram](system-architecture-diagram.md) - Visual overview
- [Command System Deep Dive](command-system-deep-dive.md) - Command processing architecture
- [Tool System Deep Dive](tool-system-deep-dive.md) - Tool execution framework

## Advanced Architectures

- [AMP Architecture Overview](amp-architecture.md) - AI Model Proxy patterns
- [Multi-Agent Orchestration](multi-agent-orchestration.md) - Coordinating multiple agents
- [Real-Time Synchronization](real-time-sync.md) - Live collaboration architecture
- [Thread Management at Scale](thread-management.md) - Conversation scaling

## Emerging Patterns

- [Tool System Evolution](tool-system-evolution.md) - Next-generation tool systems
- [Ink Yoga Reactive UI](ink-yoga-reactive-ui.md) - Terminal UI patterns
- [Emerging Patterns](emerging-patterns.md) - Experimental architectures
- [Collaborative AI Ecosystem](collaborative-ai-ecosystem.md) - Multi-system integration

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Layered Architecture
Separation of concerns through distinct layers:
- Presentation Layer (UI/CLI)
- Application Layer (Business Logic)
- Domain Layer (Core Models)
- Infrastructure Layer (External Services)

### Event-Driven Design
Asynchronous communication patterns:
- Command/Query Separation
- Event Sourcing
- Message Queuing
- Real-time Subscriptions

### Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal scaling through stateless services
- Caching strategies for performance
- Database sharding for large datasets
- CDN distribution for global reach
