# QED: AI Development Patterns - A Practitioner's Guide

Welcome to QED ("Quod Erat Demonstrandum" - "that which is demonstrated"), the evidence-based knowledge base for AI-assisted development. This practitioner's guide provides battle-tested patterns for integrating AI coding assistants into client projects and production environments.

## About QED

QED follows a rigorous evidence-based approach to AI development patterns. Every recommendation is backed by documented client project outcomes, with explicit discussion of trade-offs, limitations, and failure modes.

This guide reveals proven patterns from real production environments, including deep analysis of successful client implementations with tools like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/chat), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), and enterprise AI-assisted development workflows.

## The Three Books

### Book 1: Foundation Patterns
*Client-Safe AI Integration*

Evidence-based patterns for integrating AI coding assistants into professional development workflows:

- **Core Architecture Analysis** - Proven patterns from Claude Code and production systems
- **Client Safety Frameworks** - Risk assessment, security considerations, and compliance approaches
- **Integration Strategies** - Workflow optimization, context management, and team adoption
- **Tool Selection Criteria** - Framework evaluation based on client project outcomes
- **Permission Systems** - Security models that balance safety with productivity
- **Implementation Lessons** - Real-world deployment patterns and failure modes

For developers and consultants implementing AI-assisted workflows in client environments.

### Book 2: Production Frameworks
*Risk Assessment and Selection*

Professional guidance for evaluating and implementing AI development frameworks:

- **Framework Analysis** - Objective evaluation criteria based on client project outcomes
- **Risk Assessment Matrices** - Systematic approaches to technology selection
- **Client Profile Mapping** - Conservative, moderate, and aggressive adoption strategies
- **ROI Measurement** - Quantifying AI assistant value in professional contexts
- **Team Integration** - Collaboration patterns and workflow optimization
- **Compliance Frameworks** - Meeting client security and regulatory requirements

Essential for technical leaders making framework decisions in client environments.
