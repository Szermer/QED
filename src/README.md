# QED: AI Development Patterns

A practitioner's knowledge base for AI-assisted development, organized by risk profile and context.

## 🎯 Navigate by Your Needs

### By Risk Level
- 🟢 [**Low Risk Patterns**](by-risk/low-risk/index.md) - Start here for safe adoption
- 🟡 [**Managed Risk Patterns**](by-risk/managed-risk/index.md) - Requires safeguards
- 🔴 [**High Risk Patterns**](by-risk/high-risk/index.md) - Critical systems only

### By Context
- 🚀 [**Startup**](by-context/startup/index.md) - High agility, low process
- 📈 [**Mid-Market**](by-context/mid-market/index.md) - Scaling patterns
- 🏢 [**Enterprise**](by-context/enterprise/index.md) - Governance focus
- 🏛️ [**Regulated**](by-context/regulated/index.md) - Compliance-first

### By Domain
- [**Architecture**](patterns/architecture/index.md) - System design patterns
- [**Implementation**](patterns/implementation/index.md) - Development patterns
- [**Operations**](patterns/operations/index.md) - Deployment and maintenance
- [**Security**](patterns/security/index.md) - Access control and compliance
- [**Team**](patterns/team/index.md) - Collaboration and process
- [**Quality**](patterns/quality/index.md) - Validation and testing

## 📚 Learning Paths

- 🎓 [**Getting Started**](learning-paths/getting-started.md) - 4-week structured program
- 🏢 [**Enterprise Adoption**](learning-paths/enterprise-adoption.md) - Organizational rollout
- 🏗️ [**Agency Playbook**](learning-paths/agency-playbook.md) - Client project patterns

## 🔍 Pattern Discovery

### Multi-Dimensional Classification
Each pattern is tagged with:
- **Domain**: What problem area it addresses
- **Risk Profile**: Safety level (Green/Yellow/Red)
- **Maturity**: Experimental → Validated → Standard
- **Context**: Where it works best
- **Relationships**: Dependencies and conflicts

### Pattern Template
All patterns follow a [standard template](PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md) including:
- Executive summary with risk assessment
- Implementation guide with prerequisites
- Trade-offs and failure modes
- Validation criteria and metrics
- Real-world case studies

## 📊 Knowledge Management Tiers

### Tier 1: Research Collection
Raw articles and resources being evaluated

### Tier 2: Critical Analysis  
Patterns under professional evaluation with risk assessment

### Tier 3: Proven Practice
**QED Standard**: Only patterns validated in production with documented outcomes

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **Individual Developers**: Start with [Getting Started](learning-paths/getting-started.md)
- **Team Leads**: Focus on [Team Patterns](patterns/team/index.md) and risk management
- **Consultants**: Use [Context Guides](by-context/index.md) for client-specific approaches
- **Agencies**: See [Agency Playbook](learning-paths/agency-playbook.md)
- **Enterprise Architects**: Review [High-Risk Patterns](by-risk/high-risk/index.md)

## ⚖️ Core Principles

1. **Risk-First Navigation**: Traffic light system for immediate risk recognition
2. **Evidence-Based**: Only patterns proven in production environments
3. **Context-Aware**: Multiple paths based on your specific situation
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Understand dependencies before implementation
5. **Evolutionary Tracking**: Patterns mature as they're validated

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Safe Experimentation
1. Browse [Low-Risk Patterns](by-risk/low-risk/index.md)
2. Pick one pattern matching your context
3. Follow the implementation guide
4. Measure results
5. Share learnings

### For Production Systems
1. Complete [Risk Assessment](patterns/quality/risk-assessment.md)
2. Review patterns for your [Context](by-context/index.md)
3. Check all [Dependencies](PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md#relationships)
4. Implement with safeguards
5. Monitor continuously

## About QED

QED ("Quod Erat Demonstrandum" - "that which is demonstrated") follows a rigorous evidence-based approach. Every recommendation is backed by documented client project outcomes, with explicit discussion of trade-offs, limitations, and failure modes.

This guide reveals proven patterns from real production environments, including deep analysis of successful implementations with tools like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), and enterprise AI-assisted development workflows.
