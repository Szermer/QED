# Managed Risk Patterns (Yellow)

Patterns requiring specific safeguards and approval processes.

## Characteristics
- ⚠️ Client-facing but non-critical
- ⚠️ Requires specific safeguards
- ⚠️ Limited data exposure
- ⚠️ Needs approval process
- ⚠️ Documented contingencies

## Key Patterns

### Architecture Patterns
- [Core Architecture](../../patterns/architecture/core-architecture.md) - Full system implementation
- [Tool System Deep Dive](../../patterns/architecture/tool-system-deep-dive.md) - Extensible capabilities
- [Command System Deep Dive](../../patterns/architecture/command-system-deep-dive.md) - Command processing

### Operations Patterns
- [Parallel Tool Execution](../../patterns/operations/parallel-tool-execution.md) - Performance optimization
- [Performance at Scale](../../patterns/operations/performance-at-scale.md) - Scaling considerations

### Implementation Patterns
- [Execution Flow in Detail](../../patterns/implementation/execution-flow-in-detail.md) - Complex workflows
- [Real World Examples](../../patterns/implementation/real-world-examples.md) - Production scenarios

## Required Safeguards

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Client approval obtained
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Team trained

### During Implementation
- [ ] Phased rollout strategy
- [ ] Continuous monitoring
- [ ] Regular checkpoints
- [ ] Incident response ready

### After Implementation
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked
- [ ] User feedback collected
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Process improvements identified

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Insufficient testing** - Always test in staging first
2. **Poor communication** - Keep stakeholders informed
3. **Missing documentation** - Document decisions and changes
4. **Scope creep** - Stick to approved implementation

## Escalation Path
- Minor issues → Team lead
- Data concerns → Security team
- Client impact → Account manager
- Major incidents → CTO/Engineering lead
