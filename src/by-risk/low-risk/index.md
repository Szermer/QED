# Low Risk Patterns (Green)

Safe patterns for initial adoption with minimal client risk.

## Characteristics
- ✅ Reversible changes
- ✅ Non-critical systems only
- ✅ Internal tools focus
- ✅ No data exposure
- ✅ Clear rollback path

## Recommended Starting Points

### Implementation Patterns
- [System Prompts and Model Settings](../../patterns/implementation/system-prompts-and-model-settings.md) - Safe configuration patterns
- [Framework Selection Guide](../../patterns/implementation/framework-selection-guide.md) - Choosing appropriate tools

### Architecture Patterns
- [Ink Yoga Reactive UI](../../patterns/architecture/ink-yoga-reactive-ui.md) - Terminal UI experimentation

### Team Patterns
- [Comments and Collaboration](../../patterns/team/comments.md) - Low-risk collaboration features

## Adoption Strategy

1. **Start with internal tools** - Test on non-critical projects
2. **Document everything** - Track what works and what doesn't
3. **Gather metrics** - Measure improvement before scaling
4. **Train incrementally** - Build team confidence gradually

## Success Metrics
- Time saved on routine tasks
- Developer satisfaction scores
- Code quality metrics
- No production incidents

## Next Steps
Once comfortable with low-risk patterns, consider:
- [Managed Risk Patterns](../managed-risk/index.md) for client-facing work
- Adding monitoring and observability
- Expanding team adoption
