# High Risk Patterns (Red)

Critical patterns requiring extensive review and approval.

## ⛔ WARNING
These patterns have significant implications for:
- Production systems
- Regulatory compliance
- Financial impact
- Data privacy
- Irreversible changes

## Critical Patterns

### Security & Compliance
- [The Permission System](../../patterns/security/the-permission-system.md) - Access control critical
- [Authentication and Identity](../../patterns/security/authentication-identity.md) - User security
- [Sharing and Permissions](../../patterns/security/sharing-permissions.md) - Data access control

### Enterprise Patterns
- [Enterprise Integration](../../patterns/team/enterprise-integration.md) - Large-scale deployment
- [Multi-Agent Orchestration](../../patterns/architecture/multi-agent-orchestration.md) - Complex coordination

## Mandatory Requirements

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Executive approval** obtained
- [ ] **Legal review** completed
- [ ] **Security audit** performed
- [ ] **Compliance check** verified
- [ ] **Insurance coverage** confirmed
- [ ] **Disaster recovery** plan tested
- [ ] **Data privacy impact** assessment done
- [ ] **Third-party dependencies** reviewed

### Implementation Controls
1. **Dual approval** for all changes
2. **Audit logging** for all operations
3. **Real-time monitoring** with alerts
4. **Automated rollback** capability
5. **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
6. **Access controls** with MFA
7. **Regular security scans**
8. **Compliance reporting**

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Safeguards
- Air-gapped testing environment
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Chaos engineering exercises
- Load testing at scale
- Security penetration testing

### Process Safeguards
- Change advisory board review
- Staged rollout with hold points
- Go/no-go decision gates
- Post-implementation review
- Incident response drills

### Documentation Requirements
- Architecture decision records
- Risk assessment documents
- Compliance certifications
- Audit trail reports
- Recovery procedures

## Failure Scenarios

### Catastrophic Failures
- **Data breach**: Immediate isolation, forensics, notification
- **System compromise**: Kill switch activation, restore from backup
- **Compliance violation**: Legal team engagement, remediation plan
- **Financial loss**: Insurance claim, root cause analysis

### Recovery Procedures
1. Activate incident response team
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Assess damage scope
4. Execute recovery plan
5. Notify stakeholders
6. Conduct post-mortem
7. Implement improvements

## Regulatory Considerations

### Industry-Specific Requirements
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance mandatory
- **Finance**: PCI-DSS, SOX requirements
- **Government**: FedRAMP, security clearances
- **EU Operations**: GDPR compliance

### Audit Preparation
- Maintain compliance artifacts
- Regular self-assessments
- Third-party audits
- Continuous monitoring
- Remediation tracking

## Decision Framework

Before implementing ANY high-risk pattern:

1. **Is this absolutely necessary?**
   - Can we achieve goals with lower-risk alternatives?
   - What's the business justification?

2. **Do we have the expertise?**
   - Internal capabilities assessment
   - External consultant needs
   - Training requirements

3. **Can we afford the risk?**
   - Worst-case scenario planning
   - Insurance coverage adequacy
   - Reputation impact analysis

4. **Are we fully prepared?**
   - All safeguards in place
   - Team fully trained
   - Recovery plan tested

⚠️ **If ANY answer is "no" - STOP and reassess**
