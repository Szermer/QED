**Exercise**: Write 5 different prompts for the same task, observe differences

### Day 3-4: Core Concepts
ðŸ“– **Read**: [Introduction](../introduction.md)
- Understand the three-tier knowledge system
- Learn risk profiles (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Review the taxonomy structure

**Exercise**: Categorize 3 recent coding tasks by risk level

### Day 5: First Implementation
ðŸ“– **Read**: [System Prompts and Model Settings](../patterns/implementation/system-prompts-and-model-settings.md)
- Configure your first system prompt
- Understand model parameters
- Set up development environment

**Exercise**: Create a custom prompt for your specific domain

ðŸ“– **Read**: [Tool System Deep Dive](../patterns/architecture/tool-system-deep-dive.md)
- Learn tool interface patterns
- Understand permission models
- Implement custom tools

**Exercise**: Create a custom tool for your workflow

### Day 5: Parallel Execution
ðŸ“– **Read**: [Parallel Tool Execution](../patterns/operations/parallel-tool-execution.md)
- Optimize for performance
- Handle concurrent operations
- Manage resource usage

**Exercise**: Convert sequential operations to parallel

## Week 4: Team Adoption

### Day 1-2: Collaboration Patterns
ðŸ“– **Read**: [Comments and Collaboration](../patterns/team/comments.md)
- Set up team workflows
- Establish conventions
- Share knowledge effectively

**Exercise**: Document and share one successful pattern with your team

### Day 3-4: Security Considerations
ðŸ“– **Read**: [The Permission System](../patterns/security/the-permission-system.md)
- Implement access controls
- Understand security risks
- Set up audit logging

**Exercise**: Add permission checks to your tools

### Day 5: Lessons Learned
ðŸ“– **Read**: [Lessons Learned](../patterns/operations/lessons-learned-and-implementation-challenges.md)
- Learn from others' experiences
- Avoid common pitfalls
- Plan for challenges

**Exercise**: Create a risk mitigation plan

## Next Steps

### For Individuals
â†’ Explore [Advanced Patterns](../patterns/architecture/multi-agent-orchestration.md)
â†’ Experiment with [High-Risk Patterns](../by-risk/high-risk/index.md) in safe environments

### For Teams
â†’ Follow [Enterprise Adoption Journey](./enterprise-adoption.md)
â†’ Implement [Team Workflows](../patterns/team/team-workflows.md)

### For Agencies
â†’ Study [Agency Playbook](./agency-playbook.md)
â†’ Focus on [Client Communication](../patterns/team/enterprise-integration.md)

## Quick Reference Card

### Daily Practices
1. **Start with low-risk patterns** (Green)
2. **Document what works** and what doesn't
3. **Measure impact** with simple metrics
4. **Share learnings** with peers
5. **Iterate quickly** based on feedback

### Warning Signs
- ðŸš« Implementing high-risk patterns without experience
- ðŸš« Skipping security considerations
- ðŸš« Not measuring impact
- ðŸš« Working in isolation
- ðŸš« Ignoring failure modes

### Success Indicators
- âœ… Consistent productivity gains
- âœ… Reduced bug rates
- âœ… Team adoption growing
- âœ… Clear documentation
- âœ… Positive feedback loops
