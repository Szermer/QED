## Overview and Philosophy

Claude Code combines a terminal UI with an AI backend and a thoughtfully designed tool system. Its architecture addresses four key challenges:

1. **Instant results**: Uses async generators to stream output as it's produced.
   ```typescript
   // Streaming results with generators instead of waiting
   async function* streamedResponse() {
     yield "First part of response";
     // Next part starts rendering immediately
     yield await expensiveOperation();
   }
   ```

2. **Safe defaults**: Implements explicit permission gates for file and system modifications.

3. **Extensible by design**: Common interface patterns make adding new tools straightforward.

4. **Transparent operations**: Shows exactly what's happening at each step of execution.

The result is an AI assistant that works with your local development environment in a way that feels fast, safe, and predictable.
