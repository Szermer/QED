## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Restructure Directory Hierarchy**
```
QED/
├── patterns/
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── implementation/
│   ├── operations/
│   ├── security/
│   ├── team/
│   └── quality/
├── anti-patterns/
├── case-studies/
├── decision-trees/
└── research-queue/
```

2. **Add Taxonomy Metadata to High-Priority Documents**

Example for "Core Architecture - Agentic Systems Production Patterns":
```yaml
pattern_id: core-architecture-agentic-systems
domain: Architecture
risk_profile: Managed
maturity: Validated
contexts:
  scale: [Mid-market, Enterprise]
  regulation: [Unregulated, Light]
  prerequisites:
    tools: [Claude Code, TypeScript, React]
    skills: [Senior]
lifecycle_stage: Implementation
stability: Stable
value_type: [Quality, Innovation]
relationships:
  requires: [terminal-ui-patterns, llm-integration]
  enables: [parallel-execution, permission-systems]
last_validated: 2025-09-08
```

### Phase 2: Content Promotion (Week 2-3)

**Promote to Tier 2 (Analysis)**
1. Core Architecture patterns (from Gerred Dillon series)
2. Permission System analysis
3. Tool System Deep Dive
4. Parallel Execution patterns

**Criteria for promotion:**
- Has production evidence
- Multiple implementations referenced
- Clear implementation steps
- Documented failure modes

### Phase 3: Pattern Extraction (Week 3-4)

**Extract Discrete Patterns from Long Documents**

Current documents mix multiple patterns. Extract into focused entries:

From "Core Architecture":
- Pattern: Terminal UI with React
- Pattern: Streaming LLM Integration
- Pattern: Plugin Architecture
- Pattern: Recursive Query Loops

From "Permission System":
- Pattern: Path-based Permissions
- Pattern: Tool Permission Requests
- Pattern: Permission Persistence
- Pattern: Risk Scoring

### Phase 4: Create Navigation Aids (Week 4-5)

**Decision Trees**
```
Need: Implement AI coding assistant
├─ Regulated industry? → Start with Security patterns
├─ Team size < 10? → Start with Low Risk patterns
└─ Existing codebase? → Start with Integration patterns
```

**Learning Paths**
1. **Startup Path**: Overview → Framework Selection → Low Risk Implementation
2. **Enterprise Path**: Security → Compliance → Team Workflows → Integration
3. **Agency Path**: Client Communication → Risk Assessment → Handoff Patterns

**Pattern Relationships Map**
- Visual diagram showing dependencies between patterns
- Prerequisites and enablers clearly marked
- Conflict warnings highlighted

2. **Maturity Distribution**: 20% Tier 3, 40% Tier 2, 40% Tier 1
3. **Risk Balance**: Sufficient Low Risk patterns for safe adoption
4. **Context Completeness**: Patterns for all major contexts (startup to enterprise)
5. **Relationship Clarity**: No orphaned patterns, all dependencies mapped

## Risk Mitigation

**During Migration:**
- Keep original structure intact until new one proven
- Version control all changes for rollback
- Test with real practitioner queries
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing links

**Post-Migration:**
- Regular review cycles for tier promotion
- Feedback mechanism for pattern effectiveness
- Deprecation process for outdated patterns
- Continuous gap analysis based on user needs
