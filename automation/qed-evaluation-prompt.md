SCORING METHODOLOGY:

**Points per Section**:
- 1-2: Poor quality, significant bias, or dangerous gaps
- 3: Adequate but missing important considerations
- 4: Good quality with minor limitations
- 5: Excellent, comprehensive, production-ready

**Total Score Interpretation**:
- **5-14 points**: Tier 1 (Research Collection) - Interesting but needs significant development
- **15-22 points**: Tier 2 (Professional Analysis) - Worthy of detailed evaluation and refinement
- **23-25 points**: Tier 3 (Proven Practice) - Exceptional quality requiring validation

**Tier Placement Rules**:
- **Tier 1**: Collect for future analysis, note priority level
- **Tier 2**: Create structured analysis document, identify promotion pathway
- **Tier 3**: Rare - requires client project validation before acceptance

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use exact QED analysis template structure
2. Include specific confidence scoring rationale
3. Provide clear tier recommendation with promotion criteria
4. Identify specific knowledge gaps and validation requirements
5. Map to Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive client risk profiles
```
