We’re thrilled to announce exciting updates to UXPin’s AI Component Creator. After experimenting with generating HTML-based Tailwind UI components, our Merge AI tool now supports MUI, Ant Design, and React-Bootstrap—unlocking more possibilities for designers and developers. But that’s not all!

You can now turn static images into fully coded UI components or transform classic UXPin elements into code-backed designs with just a few clicks, paste an image of UI that will get transformed into code-backed design or automate theming.

Say goodbye to tedious coding and hello to a streamlined design-to-development workflow. It’s time to supercharge your creativity with AI. Try AI Component Creator by yourself. [Sign up for a demo](https://www.uxpin.com/merge).

Reach a new level of prototyping

Design with interactive components coming from your team’s design system.

## What is UXPin’s AI Component Creator?

UXPin’s AI Component Creator revolutionizes the way designers and developers work by bridging the gap between design and code.

Imagine a world where you can go from an idea to a fully functional [UI component](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/user-interface-elements-every-designer-should-know/) in minutes. That’s the power of UXPin’s AI Component Creator.

This tool now lets you harness the capabilities of [React-based libraries](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/top-react-component-libraries/) like MUI, Ant Design, and React-Bootstrap. Whether you’re working with a static design or a code component, the AI Component Creator transforms text prompts, images, or existing elements into [production-ready, code-backed components](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/functional-prototype/).

No more handoffs, no more inconsistencies—just seamless [design-to-code integration](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/code-to-design-vs-design-to-code-comparison/).

## Supercharge your Design-to-Development Workflow

Let’s say you’ve sketched out a UI wireframe or stumbled across a beautiful UI design. Recreating that design and translating it into code would take ages. Thankfully, there’s an easier way of going about it – AI Component Creator.

With UXPin’s AI tool, you can upload the image or write a prompt and—voilà— you get a React component that’s fully consistent with your chosen library: MUI, Ant Design or React-Bootstrap. Have a static element in your UXPin prototype? Transform it into a code-backed component with a right-click. Then, download the code behind the UI elements and speed up [React web app development](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/how-to-deploy-a-react-app/).

This streamlined process ensures consistency, reduces errors, and speeds up the overall workflow, making AI an indispensable ally in the design process. With less manual work and more time for innovation, AI Component Creator empowers you to turn your vision into reality—faster than ever.

### Turn Images into Code-Backed Components

![generate ui with ai based on image](https://studio.uxpincdn.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/generate-ui-with-ai-based-on-image-1024x448.webp)

With AI Component Creator, transforming static design images into fully functional UI components has never been easier. Simply upload an image of your UI design, and the AI analyzes it to generate code-backed components that are compatible with MUI, Ant Design, React-Bootstrap or Tailwind.

This means you can go from concept to code in seconds, skipping the manual coding process entirely. It’s a powerful feature that bridges the gap between static visuals and interactive, coded designs—perfect for speeding up prototyping and development.

### Transform UXPin Components into Coded Ones

The new AI-powered feature in UXPin allows you to transform existing UXPin components into fully functional, code-backed elements in seconds. No need to start from scratch! Simply right-click on any UXPin component and choose the AI transformation option.

AI Component Creator will convert the static UI into a coded element using your preferred library, such as MUI, Ant Design, or [React-Bootstrap](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/bootstrap-vs-react-bootstrap/). This powerful addition ensures that your designs are development-ready, maintaining consistency and speeding up the prototyping process.

### Expanded Support for Code-Backed Libraries

![generate ui with ai and get code](https://studio.uxpincdn.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/generate-ui-with-ai-and-get-code-1024x448.webp)

We’re excited to announce that UXPin’s AI Component Creator now supports a wider range of open-source libraries that teams based their [design systems](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/best-design-system-examples/) on, including:

* MUI,
* Ant Design,
* React-Bootstrap,
* Tailwind UI.

This update allows designers to generate production-ready components using their preferred library, ensuring design consistency and seamless integration with development standards. Choose the desired library, write a prompt or upload an image, and watch as AI creates fully coded components that match your design system.

### Enhanced Theming Options for MUI Components

![generate ui with ai mui theme](https://studio.uxpincdn.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/generate-ui-with-ai-mui-theme-1024x448.webp)

UXPin’s AI Component Creator supports theming for MUI components, allowing users to generate [elements that follow a theme](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/theme-switching-merge/) rather than relying on inline CSS styles. This enhancement ensures [design consistency](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/guide-design-consistency-best-practices-ui-ux-designers/) across projects while simplifying maintenance and scaling.

By applying themes to AI-generated components, designers can maintain a unified look and feel without manually adjusting styles, making it easier to update and refine designs as [requirements](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-capturing-ux-requirements/) evolve. This update empowers teams to create cohesive, production-ready components effortlessly.
