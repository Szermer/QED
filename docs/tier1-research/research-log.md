### 2025-01-08 - Agentic Systems Series Integration
**Action**: Integrated Gerred's "Building an Agentic System" complete series  
**Items Added**: 20+ comprehensive technical articles from original source material  
**Priority Assignments**:
- High (6 files): Production system analysis, tool architectures, security frameworks - immediate client value
- Medium (4 files): UI patterns, command systems - implementation-focused but not immediately urgent  
- Low (10+ files): Foundational concepts, setup patterns - background reference

**Content Quality**: Exceptional - analyzes real production systems (Claude Code, Amp, anon-kode)  
**Analysis Queue**: 
- Core Architecture → Next priority (production patterns from Claude Code/Amp analysis)
- Permission Systems → High priority (security models for client environments)
- Tool System Deep Dive → Critical for extensible architectures

**Key Discovery**: This appears to be the **original source material** that inspired the QED framework  
**Unique Value**:
- Concrete implementation patterns from production AI coding assistants
- Security frameworks beyond basic safety (contextual permissions, operation classification)
- Performance patterns for concurrent operations without race conditions
- React-based terminal UI architectures for coding assistants
- Async generator patterns for streaming responses

**Implementation**: Organized into existing kanban structure with descriptive filenames
**Client Impact**: Direct applicability to AI assistant architecture decisions and security frameworks  
**Next Actions**: 
- Begin Tier 2 analysis on Core Architecture patterns (production system analysis)
- Prioritize Permission System analysis (critical for client security requirements)
- Cross-reference with existing QED security content (Lethal Trifecta)

### 2025-01-08 - Major Knowledge Management Reorganization
**Action**: Complete restructure of research collection system  
**Items Processed**: 18+ research articles systematically organized  
**Priority Assignments**:
- High (7 files): AI architecture, security, multi-agent patterns - ready for immediate analysis
- Medium (3 files): RAG improvements, context engineering - interesting but not urgent  
- Low (3 files): Business strategy, AI research - background reading
- Archive (5 files): Files needing manual review due to access issues

**Analysis Queue**: 
- Context Engineering Slash Commands → Analysis Complete ✅ → Tier 2 `ready-for-experiment/`
- Security "Lethal Trifecta" → Next priority (production-critical)
- Multi-agent architecture patterns → Following analysis queue

**Topic Distribution**:
- AI Architecture: 6 files (multi-agent systems, agent compaction, computer use)
- Tooling Patterns: 3 files (RAG systems, context engineering)  
- Security & Compliance: 1 file (lethal trifecta - critical)
- Business/Research: 3 files (supporting context)

**Implementation**: Kanban-style folder structure operational
- `tier1-research/{high,medium,low}-priority/` for workflow management
- `tier1-research/by-topic/{ai-architecture,tooling-patterns,security-compliance}/` for cross-reference
- `tier2-analysis/{in-review,ready-for-experiment,blocked,rejected}/` for analysis workflow
- `tier3-proven/{book1,book2,book3,ready-for-integration}/` for publication pipeline

**Client Impact**: Systematic knowledge pipeline established for evidence-based pattern delivery  
**Lessons Learned**: Visual folder structure significantly improves workflow clarity and prevents knowledge from getting lost  
**Next Actions**: 
- Begin Tier 2 analysis on "Lethal Trifecta" security patterns
- Process multi-agent architecture research queue
- Add metadata templates to all organized files
- Manual review of archived files with access issues

### 2025-01-08 - QED Framework Setup
**Action**: Initial repository transformation  
**Items Added**: 12 research articles from existing collection  
**Priority Assignments**:
- High: Framework Wars, Slash Commands vs Subagents
- Medium: RAG systems, context engineering, computer use
- Low: General AI market analysis

**Analysis Queue**: Framework Wars → Risk Assessment Matrix (completed)

**Next Actions**: 
- Create analysis for slash commands vs subagents pattern
- Evaluate RAG context management for client applications

## Research Source Tracking

**High-Value Sources** (frequent analysis candidates):
- Practitioner blogs with real implementation experience
- Framework maintainer documentation and case studies
- Client feedback and industry reports

**Medium-Value Sources**:
- Technical conference presentations
- Vendor whitepapers (with skeptical analysis)
- Academic research with practical applications

**Low-Value Sources**:
- Pure theory without implementation guidance
- Marketing content without technical depth
- Rehashing of existing known patterns
