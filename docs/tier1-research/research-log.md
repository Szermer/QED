## Research Source Tracking

**High-Value Sources** (frequent analysis candidates):
- Practitioner blogs with real implementation experience
- Framework maintainer documentation and case studies
- Client feedback and industry reports

**Medium-Value Sources**:
- Technical conference presentations
- Vendor whitepapers (with skeptical analysis)
- Academic research with practical applications

**Low-Value Sources**:
- Pure theory without implementation guidance
- Marketing content without technical depth
- Rehashing of existing known patterns
