### ARCHIVE (Needs manual review)
**Location**: `docs/tier1-research/archive/`

Files moved here due to access/encoding issues:
- AI Component Creator.md
- 19 Acceptance Criteria Examples for Different Products.md  
- Claude_Code_Framework_Wars_-_Shawn's_Substack.md (unable to access - may need manual handling)
- Silicon_Valley's_Top_Coaches_Want_You_to_Stop_Fearing_AI.md
- Who_Owns,_Operates,_and_Develops_Your_VPN_Matters_An_analysis_of_transparency_vs_anonymity_in_the_VP.md

**Action Needed**: Manual review and proper categorization of archived files.

## Topic Distribution

### By Topic Areas:
- **AI Architecture**: 6 files (agents, multi-agent, compaction, etc.)
- **Tooling Patterns**: 3 files (RAG systems, context engineering)
- **Security & Compliance**: 1 file (lethal trifecta)
- **Business Strategy**: 1 file (startup impact)
- **AI Research**: 2 files (interpretability)
- **Mixed/Archive**: 5 files (needs review)

### Priority Distribution:
- **High Priority**: 13 files (ready for immediate analysis) - **+6 from Agentic Systems Series**
- **Medium Priority**: 7 files (interesting but not urgent) - **+4 from Agentic Systems Series** 
- **Low Priority**: 3 files (background reading)
- **Archive**: 5 files (needs manual attention)

**Total Collection**: 28 files (previously 18 + 10 from Agentic Systems Series)

## Recommended Next Steps

**UPDATED PRIORITIES with Agentic Systems Integration:**

1. **Immediate (Critical)**: Core Architecture analysis (production patterns from Claude Code/Amp)
2. **This Week**: Permission System analysis (security frameworks for client environments)  
3. **Next Week**: Tool System Deep Dive (extensible architectures for client projects)
4. **Following**: Cross-reference with existing security content (Lethal Trifecta + Permission Systems)
5. **Ongoing**: Add proper metadata to all files using established templates

## Analysis Pipeline Status

- **Tier 1 → Tier 2**: 1 file completed (Slash Commands vs Subagents)
- **Ready for Analysis**: 13 high-priority files (**significant increase with agentic systems content**)
- **Analysis Queue**: ~28 total files properly organized (**major expansion**)
- **Key Discovery**: Original source material for QED framework now integrated

The knowledge management system is now operational with clear workflow paths from research collection to proven practice integration.
