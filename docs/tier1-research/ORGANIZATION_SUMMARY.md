### ARCHIVE (Needs manual review)
**Location**: `docs/tier1-research/archive/`

Files moved here due to access/encoding issues:
- AI Component Creator.md
- 19 Acceptance Criteria Examples for Different Products.md  
- Claude_Code_Framework_Wars_-_Shawn's_Substack.md (unable to access - may need manual handling)
- Silicon_Valley's_Top_Coaches_Want_You_to_Stop_Fearing_AI.md
- Who_Owns,_Operates,_and_Develops_Your_VPN_Matters_An_analysis_of_transparency_vs_anonymity_in_the_VP.md

**Action Needed**: Manual review and proper categorization of archived files.

## Topic Distribution

### By Topic Areas:
- **AI Architecture**: 6 files (agents, multi-agent, compaction, etc.)
- **Tooling Patterns**: 3 files (RAG systems, context engineering)
- **Security & Compliance**: 1 file (lethal trifecta)
- **Business Strategy**: 1 file (startup impact)
- **AI Research**: 2 files (interpretability)
- **Mixed/Archive**: 5 files (needs review)

### Priority Distribution:
- **High Priority**: 7 files (ready for immediate analysis)
- **Medium Priority**: 3 files (interesting but not urgent)
- **Low Priority**: 3 files (background reading)
- **Archive**: 5 files (needs manual attention)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Tier 2 analysis on high-priority AI architecture files
2. **This Week**: Review and properly categorize archived files  
3. **Next Week**: Process medium-priority tooling patterns
4. **Ongoing**: Add proper metadata to all files using established templates

## Analysis Pipeline Status

- **Tier 1 → Tier 2**: 1 file completed (Slash Commands vs Subagents)
- **Ready for Analysis**: 6 high-priority files
- **Analysis Queue**: ~15 total files properly organized

The knowledge management system is now operational with clear workflow paths from research collection to proven practice integration.
