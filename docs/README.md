# Research Collection

This directory contains **Tier 1** content - raw research material captured for potential analysis.

## Purpose

Capture anything potentially relevant to AI-assisted development without editorial filtering. This is your research inbox - collect liberally, analyze selectively.

## Standards

- **No filtering**: Save first, evaluate later
- **Full attribution**: Always include source, author, date
- **Context notes**: Brief note on why you saved it
- **Priority tagging**: High/Medium/Low for analysis queue

## File Organization

### Current Research (Active Review)
Articles and resources under consideration for analysis.

### Archive
Research that's been analyzed, implemented, or determined irrelevant.

## Research Log

Track research intake and analysis decisions in `research-log.md`.
