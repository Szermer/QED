# QED Research Collection

**Tier 1**: Raw research material following QED knowledge management framework.

## Current Structure

### Date-Based Intake Processing
- `2025-09-09-intake/` - Latest batch of articles processed through QED intake workflow
  - See individual folder README for priority assessments and next actions

### Organized Research Collection  
- `tier1-research/` - Systematic research organization by priority and topic
  - `high-priority/` - Items for immediate Tier 2 analysis
  - `medium-priority/` - Interesting patterns worth exploring  
  - `low-priority/` - Background reading and context
  - `archive/` - Processed or irrelevant items

### Reference Material
- `qed-evaluation-prompt.md` - Evaluation criteria for knowledge intake
- `web-coding-book.pdf`, `2508.16153v2.pdf` - Reference documents
- `building-an-agentic-system-main/` - Archived material from earlier research

## Workflow

1. **Daily Intake**: New articles saved to dated intake folders (`YYYY-MM-DD-intake/`)
2. **Priority Assessment**: Each intake batch gets comprehensive priority analysis
3. **Organization**: Articles moved to appropriate `tier1-research/` folders based on assessment
4. **Promotion**: High-priority items advance to Tier 2 analysis (`src/analysis/`)

## Standards

- **Capture everything** - No editorial filter at intake stage  
- **Source attribution** - Always maintain original source and author information
- **Priority tagging** - Clear assessment of relevance to client work
- **Context notes** - Brief reasoning for why material was captured
